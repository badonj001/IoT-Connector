9.) The menu does not require you to swipe from the left side edge of the screen, to make this work all of the way back to Android Jelly Bean so older Android device could be used, you can just swipe right on an area on yor page without any controls.

10. If the menu is open and you wnat to stay on the page, then swipe left.  

11.) to refresh a page, swipe right and select the link for that page again.

12.) If you make any cool changes or upgrades I would apprecite it if yo let me know so I can also enjoy them, :).

13.) I am not an expert Android Developer. If something is broken and yo can fix it, then please do so. 


This is just a simple full screen app and was desiged for connecting to ESP32 webserver devices, OctoPrint ports, and other IoT projects.
